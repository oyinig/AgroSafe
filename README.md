# AgroSafe
A blockchain based agro-product tracking from sourcing to sales for the entire world but starting from Africa. Digital signatures provide part of the solution as agro-products' data will be traceable at any point using the product signature on the blockchain. The network allows industrial buyers to buy products using regualar fiat currencies at a standard listing price or at a discount using AgroSafe coin. AgroSafe and Agrosafe's partners are entities with write permissions and read to all.  AgroSafe partners will include testing labouratories, warehouses, agro-traders annd freighters. AgroSafe will start as lean as possible and takes in partners as the network grows larger.
